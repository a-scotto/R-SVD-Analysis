# Reproducibility of Randomized SVD Analysis.

## Generating the experimental data

The data can be (re)generated using the script _data_generation.py_. The computed data are stored in two JSON files depending on which pramater varies.

## Plots: Experimental erros vs. Theoretical bounds

To generate the plots presented in the paper, simply run _plots.py_. Note that the script do not open the figures, it saves it as PDF.
